## Overview

Build out a product preview card component and get it to look as close as possible to the design preview and style-guide.

Important note: I followed the intstructions literally, and so the webpage link below will only work at the specified 375px and 1440px. In the future, I will have the component change from vertical to horizontal at a screen width in-between the two.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size:
  - Mobile: width = 375px
  - Desktop: width = 1440px
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
